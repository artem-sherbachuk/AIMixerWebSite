Last updated: (February 2026)

AI Mixer (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This document explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the AI Mixer – AI Generator mobile application and related services.

1. Information We Collect

We may collect the following types of information:

1.1 Personal Information
AI Mixer does not require account registration and does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number.

1.2 User Content
When you use AI Mixer, you may upload:
	•	Photos
	•	Videos
	•	Audio files
	•	Text prompts

This content is used only to provide the requested AI features (AI photo, video, and voice generation).

Uploaded content may be temporarily stored on our servers to process requests and deliver results.

1.3 Usage Data
We collect anonymized usage data through Firebase Analytics, such as:
	•	App interactions
	•	Feature usage
	•	Crash reports
	•	Device type and OS version

This data helps us improve app performance and user experience.

1.4 Face Data
AI Mixer may process facial imagery in the following features:
Face Swap
When you use the Face Swap feature, your uploaded photo may contain facial imagery. This photo is sent to a third-party AI processing server solely to generate the requested image result. We do not extract, store, or use any biometric facial data such as face geometry or facial recognition identifiers. Uploaded photos are deleted from the server immediately after the AI-generated result is delivered. Face data is not shared with any third parties for advertising, analytics, or any other unrelated purpose.
Lip Detection for Subtitle Alignment (Video Editor)
The app uses Apple's Vision framework to detect facial landmark positions (such as lip coordinates) for the purpose of aligning subtitles with the speaker's mouth in the video editor. This processing is performed entirely on the user's device using Apple's on-device APIs. No facial landmark data is transmitted to any server, stored persistently, or shared with any third party. The data exists only in device memory during active use and is discarded immediately when processing is complete.
